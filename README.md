# Sign Language Detection


This project implements a Sign Language Detection System using computer vision and machine learning. It processes hand gestures captured through a webcam or dataset and classifies them into corresponding alphabets or words from sign language.

The system uses image preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning models (like CNNs) to recognize hand signs with accuracy. It can be extended for real-time applications, enabling communication between hearing-impaired individuals and others.

The project demonstrates:

🖐️ Hand gesture recognition using sign language datasets

🤖 Deep learning models (CNN / transfer learning) for classification

🎥 Real-time detection using webcam integration (OpenCV / MediaPipe)

📊 Training, evaluation, and accuracy visualization

This work is a step towards making technology more inclusive and accessible, bridging communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
